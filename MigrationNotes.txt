====== Intro

- A lot of structual changes to split out rendering from SadConsole. You now need to add SadConsole.Host.MonoGame or SadConsole.Host.SFML to your project.

- All console's have a viewport again, eliminating the ScrollingConsole type. This is implemented in a few properties.
  - ScrollingConsole.ViewPort -> Console.View

- SadConsole.Global is gone. All properties moved to SadConsole.GameHost.Instance

===== TODO

- (?) Components should have a before/after ability where SortOrder < 5 run before the core code and >=5 run after.
- Print for surface can be optimized. Use SetEffect(IEnumerable) to mass update effects instead of individual cells.
- Check ListBox.ScrollToSelectedItem is working.
- Do all of the Theme.RefreshTheme methods get sent control.FindColors? If so, we can get rid of the base logic that finds them...
- SFML is *still* throwing in phantom keys when you type fast or use multiple keys are once.
- Character viewer in sample isn't working.

====== New Features

- Controls have a Tag property for user-definable data.
- Window now has the following features:
  - Shown event when the window is made visible.
  - OnShown protected virtual method.
  - OnHidden protected virtual method.
  - DrawBorder replaces Invalidated method.
- Draw/Update have restored the TimeSpan parameter.
- Controls are hosted by a ControlHost component, allowing a GUI added to any console.
- ControlsConsole and Window each derive from Console and have a Controls property of type ControlHost.
- SadConsole.Global no longer exists. Properties from this static type now live in SadConsole.GameHost.Instance.
- Renderer can now have RenderSteps added to them to inject custom rendering processing without creating a new renderer.

====== Migration notes

Core
- (RENAME) Font/FontMaster -> Font
- (RENAME) SadConsole.Global -> SadConsole.GameHost

CellSurface/Console
- (RENAME) Components -> SadComponents
- (CHANGE) Console.New(surface) now wraps the existing surface, using its reference. Doesn't copy cells anymore.

Console
- (CHANGE) FontSize property is a point x,y size now no longer the enum. Use Font.GetFontSize

ControlsConsole/Window
- (RENAME) ViewPort -> View
- (CHANGE) Themes removed

Window
- (RENAME) Invalidate/OnInvalidated -> DrawBorder
- (CHANGE) DrawBorder is used to draw the border and title.
- (CHANGE) No longer inherits from ControlsConsole.

ControlsConsole
- (CHANGE) No longer a specialized type. The ControlHost component was created and provides the entire controls framework.
  This can be applied to any console. The ControlsConsole is now just a simple Console with this component automatically added.
- (CHANGE) Controls are added to a ControlsConsole through the Controls property: MyControlsConsole.Add(control) is now MyControlsConsole.Controls.Add(control)

ScrollingConsole
- (MOVE) All ViewPort stuff is implemented on ICellSurface, meaning all surfaces can scroll.
- (RENAME) ViewPort -> View

LayeredConsole
- (RENAME) LayeredScreenSurface

Input
- (RENAME) MouseConsoleState -> MouseScreenObjectState

UI
- (MOVE) SadConsole.Controls -> SadConsole.UI.Controls
